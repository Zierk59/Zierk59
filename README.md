## Hi there üëã

I'm a **fullstack developer** with a passion for creating efficient and scalable software solutions. My stack include C#/.NET and TypeScript, but my journey through programming has been quite diverse.

### üíª My Journey
I started coding at the age of 14, beginning with the **basics‚ÄîHTML** and **CSS**. From there, I moved on to **JavaScript** and then got into creating game modes and scripts for online multiplayer games using Pawn. This early experience sparked a curiosity that led me to learn **PHP** and, eventually, **C++** and **C#** when I started experimenting with reverse engineering and cheat development for PC games. While I lost interest in that due to potential legal issues, it was an invaluable learning experience that deepened my love for software development.

Today, programming is more than just a job‚Äîit's a **hobby, work, and passion** that drives me to continuously learn and innovate. I strive to make an impact with my code by building high-quality, scalable solutions.
